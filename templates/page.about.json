After all, I wasn’t going to try and cook up my own wax - that simply wasn’t my specialty. <br\/><\/p><p>But before all hope was lost, I met “The Scientist” behind “Black Mountains” - a lifelong surfer from Southern California who’d been cooking up super sticky concoctions for over 20 years and perfecting his craft. Fast forward to today and after running through a handful of test runs, we are proud to present “Batch #1” in the boiling hot summer of 2022.<\/p>",
